# Project Overview

> **🌱 Smart IoT Ecosystem**
> 
> PhytoPi is a smart IoT ecosystem designed to automate and monitor plant growth in controlled environments. The system integrates hardware sensors, Raspberry Pi control, cloud data management, and mobile/web applications to deliver real-time environmental insights and plant health analytics.
> 
> The project's goal is to autonomously sustain a full bean plant growth cycle while providing users with live monitoring, alerts, and predictive analysis through a unified app interface.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Environmental Monitoring:** Continuous data collection for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light, and CO₂ sensors

- **Secure Cloud Infrastructure:** Built on Supabase with Row-Level Security (RLS) for user-specific data isolation

- **Cross-Platform Dashboard:** Flutter app (Android/iOS/Web) displays real-time readings, charts, and device health

- **Alert System:** Automated notifications for threshold breaches (e.g., low moisture, high temperature)

- **Offline-Resilient Device Agent:** Python-based Raspberry Pi agent caches data locally and uploads in batches

- **AI Integration (Phase 2):** On-device TensorFlow Lite or cloud ML microservice for plant health inference

- **Kiosk Mode:** Raspberry Pi can display live dashboards using Chromium in kiosk mode for lab or greenhouse use

- **Monetization-Ready Architecture:** Stripe integration for subscription tiers and device management

# 🏗️ Technical Architecture

## 🔧 Hardware Layer

- **Raspberry Pi 5** + Sensor Array (moisture, temp, humidity, light, CO₂)

- **Device Agent:** Python + SQLite for local buffering, secure upload to Supabase Edge Functions

## ☁️ Backend Infrastructure

- **Supabase:** PostgreSQL, RLS, Edge Functions, Storage, Auth

- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for migrations, tests, and deployment

## 📱 Frontend Applications

- **Flutter:** Mobile + Web, realtime charts, user settings, notifications

- **Kiosk Mode:** Raspberry Pi displays live dashboards using Chromium

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
Sensors → Pi Agent → Edge Function → Supabase DB → Realtime → Mobile/Web UI
```
